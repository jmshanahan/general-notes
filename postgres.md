## Starting up

When I installed postgres I then entered
```
sudo -u postgres psql postgres
```
This will bring you to the  postgres prompt.
Postgres does not have a default password on installation.
Therefore then you will need to enter the following
```
\password postgres
```

You will be prompted to enter a password.

Then you are basically right to go.

You can then set up pgAdmin
